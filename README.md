# MyMath

A Java project in the course OOP, The project deal and solve polynomials equations.


## Polynom

Is consists of Monom's

- Polynom
  - Monom's
    - Power
    - Coefficient


## Monom

 In order to implement **Polynom**, First create **Monom** class

 - Monom
   - Power
   - Coefficient



The project applies the next action on **polynomials**
 ```
  Addition
  Subtraction
  Multiplication
  Equal
  Area
  Derivative
  Integral
 ```
 
 
## Main Methods 
```
 Add Polynom
   f(x) + g(x)
 
 Add Monom
   f(x) + ax^n
 
 Multiply
   f(x) * g(x)
 
 Subtraction
   f(x) - g(x) 
 
 Root
   f(x) = 0 
```
