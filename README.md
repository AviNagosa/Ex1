 In this project we implement polynom. The project applies functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication ,equal, area, derivative implementation, and integral
 In order to implement the polynom, we first implement the monom( because polynom in its definition consists of monoms).
 In the monom class, the object has two fields for the power and coefficient.
 Polynom class contain copy constructor and constructor who get polynom from type string and converts and initializes the polynom.
 This constructor and function also shows in the monom Class for neat code.
 
 Function : 
 
 Add polynom : connection of two polynom 
 Add monom : connection of a single monon to the polynom
 Area : calculate the area under the function and above the x axis by placing two points and eps
 Root : calculation the root function that is the solution of the function when f(x) = 0
 Multiply : multiply of a polynom in another polynom when the trans is performed on the polynom source
 Subtract : subtraction between two polynom
 ToString : prints the polynom to the screen 
 
 
 Notes : 
 During the project I did use vector and iterator for the first times.
